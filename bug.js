In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when navigating using the `useNavigate` hook within a component that hasn't yet fully mounted. This can happen if you try to redirect immediately within a component's `useEffect` hook before the component's state has been properly initialized.  The `useNavigate` hook might not be properly initialized leading to an error or unexpected behavior. For example:

```javascript
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

function MyComponent() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  useEffect(() => {
    //This will cause an error if the component hasn't mounted yet.
    navigate('/dashboard'); 
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {/* ... */}
    </div>
  );
}
```
